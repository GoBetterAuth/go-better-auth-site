title: Config
---

The GoBetterAuth config is the main configuration of the framework. It is very flexible and comes with default configurations for you to customise. GoBetterAuth is very flexible in that each plugin comes with its own config too providing you with more control over your authentication system. This also keeps the main config here clean and easy to maintain with less chances for bugs and issues as you are not forced to include plugin-specific settings if you don't need them.

You can view the full config here: [Source Code](https://github.com/GoBetterAuth/go-better-auth/blob/main/models/config.go)

You can view the configs of each plugin within their respective folders in the [plugins directory](https://github.com/GoBetterAuth/go-better-auth/tree/main/plugins).
